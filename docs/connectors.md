# Connector setup

Every connector is added through the same flow: run `void setup`, pick the service, follow the prompts. This page covers what each service needs.

| Connector | Credentials needed | Sync mechanism |
|-----------|--------------------|----------------|
| [WhatsApp](#whatsapp) | None — QR code | wa-rs WebSocket (push) |
| [Telegram](#telegram) | None — QR code | grammers MTProto (push) |
| [Slack](#slack) | Slack app tokens | Socket Mode WebSocket (push) |
| [Gmail](#gmail--google-calendar) | Built-in OAuth (or your own) | `history.list` polling |
| [Google Calendar](#gmail--google-calendar) | Built-in OAuth (or your own) | `syncToken` polling |
| [Google Drive](#google-drive) | Built-in OAuth (or your own) | On-demand (no sync) |
| [LinkedIn](#linkedin-unipile) | Unipile API key | Unipile API polling |
| [Hacker News](#hacker-news) | None — public API | HN API polling |

## WhatsApp

No external credentials needed.

1. Run `void setup` and select WhatsApp
2. Scan the QR code with your phone: **WhatsApp → Linked Devices → Link a Device**

## Telegram

No external credentials needed.

1. Run `void setup` and select Telegram
2. Scan the QR code with your phone: **Telegram → Settings → Devices → Link Desktop Device**

Optionally, set your own `api_id` / `api_hash` in the connection config — see [Configuration](configuration.md#connections).

## Slack

Create a Slack app with a **user token** (`xoxp-…`) and an **app-level token** (`xapp-…`) with Socket Mode enabled. Add both tokens through `void setup`.

```toml
[[connections]]
id = "work-slack"
type = "slack"
app_token = "xapp-1-..."
user_token = "xoxp-..."
```

## Gmail & Google Calendar

Built-in OAuth2 credentials are included — **no Google Cloud setup required**:

1. Run `void setup` and select Gmail or Calendar
2. Accept the default built-in credentials (or provide your own Google Cloud credentials file via `credentials_file`)
3. Complete the OAuth flow in your browser

Gmail and Calendar share the same OAuth credentials, so adding the second one after the first is instant. By default Calendar syncs your primary calendar; list more with `calendar_ids`.

## Google Drive

Drive is on-demand (download/info/export) rather than synced. It reuses the same Google OAuth flow:

```bash
void drive auth
void drive download "https://docs.google.com/document/d/..." -o report.md
```

## LinkedIn (Unipile)

LinkedIn messages are synced through the [Unipile](https://www.unipile.com/) API. You need a Unipile account with a connected LinkedIn profile.

1. Sign up at [dashboard.unipile.com](https://dashboard.unipile.com)
2. Connect your LinkedIn account in the Unipile dashboard
3. Copy your **API key**, **DSN** (API base URL), and **account ID**
4. Run `void setup`, select LinkedIn, and paste the credentials

```toml
[[connections]]
id = "linkedin"
type = "linkedin"
api_key = "your-unipile-api-key"
dsn = "https://api1.unipile.com:13111"
account_id = "your-unipile-account-id"
```

Send messages with `void send --via linkedin --to <chat-id-or-linkedin-member-id> --message "..."`. For new conversations with a connection, use the recipient's LinkedIn provider ID (often starts with `ACo`). For existing chats, use the Unipile chat ID or the void conversation external ID.

In addition to DMs, sync pulls **comments on your own posts** (Unipile Posts & Comments API). Each post appears as a thread conversation (`kind: thread`); comments are messages with `metadata.source = linkedin_post_comment`. Reply to a comment with `void reply`, same as DMs.

## Hacker News

No credentials needed — the HN API is public. Run `void setup`, select Hacker News, enter keywords to watch and a minimum score threshold. Stories matching your keywords above the score threshold land in your inbox on each sync cycle.

```toml
[[connections]]
id = "hackernews"
type = "hackernews"
keywords = ["rust", "ai", "startup"]
min_score = 100
```

Tune it later without editing the config:

```bash
void hn keywords add "sqlite,local-first"
void hn min-score 150
void hn config
```

## Multiple accounts

Add as many connections as you want, including several of the same type. Target a specific one anywhere with `--connection <id>`:

```bash
void inbox --connection work-slack
void gmail search "newer_than:7d" --connection you@gmail.com
```
